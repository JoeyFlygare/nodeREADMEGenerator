# Node README Generator
  ## Description
  This is a README generator that allows you to put together a md file through the command line using node.js. This project was created to simplify the process of making professional README files for projects. This project  helped me to better understand the process of developing apps that run in the command line and broadened my knowledge on things like writeToFile data path.
  ## Installation
  To install this code simply create a fork from the fork button in the top left corner to create a new repo for your github repositories.
  ## Usage
  To use this code you will access it by navigating to the file you have it stored in using your bash, or other command line interface, and use the node command followed by the name of the file you have it saved under. Then you will fill out the prompt as instructed to create your file.
  ## Credits
  To create this I used the inquirer npm to get the users inputs in the command line.
